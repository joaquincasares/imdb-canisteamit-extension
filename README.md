# (Unofficial) IMDB - CanISteamIt Extension

Not pushed to the Chrome extension library due to concerns over smashing the server.
Perhaps when CanIStreamIt's servers are a bit faster.

Plus needs better presentation for IMDB layout.

Would also highly benefit from not using i-frames since that tends to bog down Chrome,
especially if many movies exist on the watchlist.

## Description

Adds the CanISteamIt i-frame to all results in a user's IMDB Watchlist.
